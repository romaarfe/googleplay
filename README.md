#### ‚ö†Ô∏è PROJECT:
*In this project, you‚Äôll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You‚Äôll press ‚Äúwatch next episode‚Äù to discover if Netflix‚Äôs movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.*

*You‚Äôll also gain experience in an essential data science skill ‚Äî exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!*

# **The Android App Market on Google Play**

## *Load, clean, and visualize scraped Google Play Store data to gain insights into the Android app market.*

#
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this project, you will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. You'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. The data files are as follows:

- apps.csv: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.
- user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine and tagged with its sentiment score.

#
1. Google Play Store apps and reviews
2. Data cleaning
3. Correcting data types
4. Exploring app categories
5. Distribution of app ratings
6. Size and price of an app
7. Relation between app category and app price
8. Filter out "junk" apps
9. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
10. Sentiment analysis of user reviews
